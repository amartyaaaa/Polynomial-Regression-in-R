# Polynomial-Regression-in-R
This ML model describes the polynomial linear regression model in R. It uses a dataset of 10 entries which has the info of salary based on position. It can be used to predict the salary of the person based on the level which he is now.
Polynomial regression is a special case of linear regression where we fit a polynomial equation on the data with a curvilinear relationship between the target variable and the independent variables.

In a curvilinear relationship, the value of the target variable changes in a non-uniform manner with respect to the predictor (s).
